# 🦀 Rust Journey: Getting Started

## 1️⃣ Installing Rust

### 🐧 Linux/🍎 macOS
Use the terminal:
```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
Add to `PATH` manually if needed:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```
Ensure a 🛠️ C compiler/linker is installed.

### 🪟 Windows
1️⃣ Go to [Rust Installation Page](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html).
2️⃣ Install Build Tools for Visual Studio (2017+).

### ✅ Check Installation
```bash
rustc --version
```

### 🔄 Update Rust
```bash
rustup update
```

### ❌ Uninstall Rust
```bash
rustup self uninstall
```

---

## ✍️ Writing "Hello, World!"

### 📁 Create a Directory for Your Project
```bash
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
```

### ✏️ Create and Edit `main.rs`
Create a file named `main.rs` and add:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### ▶️ Compile and Run
#### 🐧/🍎 Linux/macOS
```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```
#### 🪟 Windows
```cmd
rustc main.rs
.\main.exe
```

---

## 🧩 Anatomy of "Hello, World!"

### 🛠️ Function Declaration
```rust
fn main() {
}
```
- `fn` declares a 🛠️ function.
- `main` is the 🏁 entry point of a Rust program.
- `{}` encloses the function body.

### 🖨️ Print Line
```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```
- `println!` is a 🔧 macro.
- Ends with a semicolon `;`.

---

## 🔄 Compiling and Running

Rust compiles programs 🕒 ahead of time:
```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```
- Produces a 📦 binary executable (e.g., `main` or `main.exe`).

Unlike 📜 dynamic languages, Rust binaries can 🏃 without Rust installed.

---

## 📚 Documentation

### 📂 Open Local Docs
```bash
rustup doc
```

### 🗂️ Use the Standard Library API Docs
- Access offline 📖 documentation for reference.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❓ Common Issues
- Check if Rust is added to `PATH`.

### 🌐 Resources
- [Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust)
- `#rust` IRC channel.

With "Hello, World!" successfully running, you're now a 🦀 Rustacean! 🎉

# Hello, Cargo!

## What is Cargo? 🚢

Cargo is Rust's build system and 📦 package manager. Most Rustaceans 🦀 use Cargo for:
- 📜 Building code
- 📥 Downloading libraries (dependencies)
- 🔧 Managing dependencies

Rust projects without dependencies (like "Hello, World!") primarily use Cargo for building code. However, as your projects grow, Cargo simplifies adding and managing dependencies.

Cargo comes pre-installed with Rust if you used the official installers. To check if Cargo is installed:
```bash
cargo --version
```
If you see an error, follow your installation method's documentation to install Cargo.

---

## Creating a Project with Cargo 🛠️

Navigate to your projects directory and run:
```bash
cargo new hello_cargo --bin
cd hello_cargo
```
- Creates a new binary executable named `hello_cargo`.
- Initializes a Git repository and generates:
  - `Cargo.toml` (configuration file)
  - `src/main.rs` (source code file)

### Exploring `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
```
- `[package]`: Project details (name, version, author).
- `[dependencies]`: List of required libraries (crates).

### Generated `src/main.rs`
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
Cargo organizes code into the `src` directory, keeping the top-level directory for configuration files like `Cargo.toml`.

---

## Building and Running a Cargo Project 🏗️

### Build Your Project
```bash
cargo build
```
- Compiles code into `target/debug/hello_cargo` (or `.exe` on Windows).

### Run the Executable
```bash
./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

### Combine Build and Run
```bash
cargo run
```
- Automatically recompiles if the source code has changed.

### Check Code Without Building
```bash
cargo check
```
- Faster than `cargo build` since it skips generating an executable. Use it frequently while coding to ensure everything compiles.

---

## Building for Release 🚀

For optimized builds, use:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
- Generates an executable in `target/release`.
- Optimizations improve runtime speed but increase compilation time.

---

## Cargo Commands Recap 📜

- `cargo build`: Compile the project.
- `cargo run`: Compile and run the project.
- `cargo check`: Check for compilation errors without building.
- `cargo build --release`: Compile optimized code for release.
- `rustfmt`: To format the rust program. 

---

## Why Use Cargo? 🤔

Cargo simplifies managing complex projects with multiple dependencies (crates). It's also consistent across operating systems, making it essential for Rust development.

To explore existing projects:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
cargo build
```
