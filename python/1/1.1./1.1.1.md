# 1.1.1. What is a computer programming language? : Short Notes 

## 1. **Language as Communication**
   - **Human Language**: Used to communicate with people.
   - **Programming Language**: Used to communicate with computers.

## 2. **English in Learning**
   - English is used to give instructions in this course.
   - Similarly, programming languages give instructions to computers.

## 3. **Programming Basics**
   - Programming languages help:
     - Represent data (numbers, text, images).
     - Provide instructions to work with data.
   - **No expertise needed**: Basic logic is enough to write programs.

## 4. **Python**
   - **Type**: High-level, interpreted, general-purpose language.
   - **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax, beginner-friendly.
   - **Example**: `print("Hello!")` prints "Hello!" on the screen.

## 5. **Analogies**
   - **Human Language**:
     - English: "Hello!"
     - Spanish: "Hola!"
   - **Programming Language**:
     - Python: `print("Hello!")`

## 6. **Source Code**
   - **Definition**: Instructions written in a programming language.
   - **Example**: `print("Hello!")` is Python code.

## 7. **Program**
   - **Definition**: A sequence of instructions for the computer.
   - **Example**: `print("Hello!")` is a simple program.

## 8. **Interactive Links**
   - Purple underlined words are clickable links for more info.

## 9. **Task**
   - Select correct statements from given options.
